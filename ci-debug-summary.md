# CI Debugging Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions CI workflow for deploying a Deno plugin was failing due to permission issues when creating projects on Deno Deploy.

## Debugging Steps
1. Used `gh` CLI to list recent workflow runs:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=hello-plugin-deploy.yml --limit 5
   ```

2. Examined failed run logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view 15756521971 --log-failed
   ```

3. Identified errors:
   ```
   APIError: The authorization token is not valid: You don't have permission to access the project
   ```

4. Implemented fixes:
   - Added organization ID to project creation API call
   - Replaced `deployctl` action with direct curl deployment
   - Verified project creation and deployment in separate steps

## Solution
Modified the workflow to:
1. Create projects using organization ID
2. Deploy using direct curl upload instead of `deployctl`
3. Added better error handling and logging

## Current Status
- Workflow now completes successfully
- Plugin is deployed to Deno Deploy
- [Latest successful run](https://github.com/0x4007/deno-deploy-debugging/actions/runs/15757280124)

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Add deployment URL to CI output
- [ ] Document workflow in tech-context.md
- [ ] Implement reusable workflow templates for other projects
