# Progress: CI Template Status

## What Works
- Documentation structure established
- Core concepts defined
- Example project (hello-world) created
- Hello world plugin created
- Deployment workflow implementation completed

## What's Left to Build
1. Implement reusable workflow templates:
   - [ ] Linting workflow
   - [ ] Testing workflow
   - [ ] Build workflow
   - [x] Deployment workflow (hello-world example)
2. Create example project to test templates âœ“ Done (hello-world)
3. Write documentation for template usage
4. Add configuration options

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Template testing
- **Completion**: 50%
- **Next Milestone**: Resolve Docker issues for local testing or test in GitHub environment

## Known Issues
- Local testing with `act` fails due to Docker socket configuration issues
- Deployment workflow needs testing in a real environment
- Limited ecosystem support (only JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Configuration system not defined

## Local Testing Results
Attempted to test CI workflows locally using `act`:
- Installed `act` via Homebrew
- Encountered Docker socket permission issues
- Tried various `act` flags and configurations without success
- Verified Docker is running but `act` can't access the socket

### Recommendations:
1. Test workflows directly in GitHub environment
2. Investigate Docker socket permissions on macOS
3. Consider alternative CI testing tools
