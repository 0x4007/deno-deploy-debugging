# Progress: Deno Deploy CI/CD Complete

## What Works
- ✅ Basic hello world app deployment structure
- ✅ Plugin system with hello plugin example
- ✅ GitHub repository setup
- ✅ Complete GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
  - ✅ Automatic deployment on push to main
  - ✅ Branch preview deployments (via project name generation)
  - ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Deployment configuration
  - ✅ Project name generation (repo-branch format)
  - ✅ Organization support
  - ✅ Production vs preview deployments (based on default branch)
- ✅ Reusable GitHub Actions
  - ✅ app-deploy action
  - ✅ plugin-deploy action
  - ✅ deno-deploy core action
- ✅ Error handling and project creation logic
- ✅ Test workflows for validation

## Deployment URLs
- App: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev
- Plugin: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev

## What's Left to Build
1. Add deployment URL to CI job summaries
2. Create additional reusable workflows:
   - [ ] Linting workflow (deno lint)
   - [ ] Testing workflow (deno test)
   - [ ] Build workflow (for projects that need it)
3. Document workflow usage in tech-context.md
4. Implement:
   - [ ] Cleanup strategy for old Deno Deploy projects
   - [ ] Environment-specific deployments (staging/production)
   - [ ] Support for deployment to existing projects

## Plugin Template Integration
- Added plugin-template as a git submodule in plugins/plugin-template
- Created adapter to make template compatible with our Deno Deploy plugin system
- Added test workflow at .github/workflows/test-plugin-template-deploy.yml
- Plugin-template is now ready for deployment

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Implementation Complete
- **Completion**: 90%
- **Next Milestone**: Add deployment URL to job summaries
- **CI Status**: All workflows passing

## Latest CI Results

### App Deployment (Successful)
- **Workflow**: test-app-deploy.yml
- **Status**: ✅ Passing
- **Deployment**: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev

### Plugin Deployment (Successful)
- **Workflow**: test-plugin-deploy.yml
- **Status**: ✅ Passing
- **Latest Run**: 15762570680
- **Key Fix**: Corrected import path in generated deno entry point

## Key Implementation Details
1. **Project Creation**: Uses deployctl with organization support
2. **Deployment Method**: Uses deployctl deploy command
3. **Environment Variables**: Filtered and passed via .env file
4. **Import Path Resolution**: Fixed for plugin deployments
5. **Conditional Checkout**: Prevents file overwrites in nested actions

## Known Issues
- None currently - all deployment issues resolved
