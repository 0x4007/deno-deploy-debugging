# Active Context: Deno Deploy CI Complete

## Current Focus
- Completed Deno Deploy CI workflow setup
- Created reusable workflow templates
- Fixed deployment issues

## Recent Changes
- Fixed hello-plugin-deploy.yml to deploy TypeScript directly (no compilation needed)
- Added deployment URL output to CI job summary
- Created reusable Deno Deploy workflow template at `.github/workflows/templates/deno-deploy.yml`
- Updated hello-plugin-deploy.yml to use the reusable template
- Updated tech-context.md with workflow documentation
- Updated progress.md to reflect completed tasks

## Next Steps
1. Monitor next deployment to ensure workflow works correctly
2. Consider implementing cleanup strategy for old Deno Deploy projects
3. Create additional reusable workflows for:
   - Linting (deno lint)
   - Testing (deno test)
   - Building (for projects that need it)
4. Add support for deployment to existing projects (vs creating new ones)

## Active Decisions
- Using direct curl API calls instead of deployctl for better control
- Creating new projects per deployment (needs cleanup strategy)
- Deno Deploy supports TypeScript natively - no build step needed
- Using job summaries for easy access to deployment URLs
