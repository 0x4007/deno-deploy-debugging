# Active Context: Plugin Template Deployment Debugging

## Current Focus
- Resolving deployment issues with plugin-template submodule
- Developing robust CI/CD pipeline for Deno Deploy
- Maintaining separation between core project and plugin code

## Recent Changes
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for plugin deployment
- Created adapter to make plugin-template compatible with Deno Deploy
- Added automated import extension fixing in CI pipeline
- Developed script to handle Deno module resolution quirks
- Fixed submodule handling in CI environment

## Key Challenges
1. Module resolution failures during deployment
2. Submodule management in CI environment
3. Import extension requirements in Deno
4. Maintaining plugin source integrity while adapting for deployment

## Solutions Implemented
- Added CI step to automatically fix import extensions
- Created script to modify imports without changing source code
- Improved submodule checkout process in workflow
- Added verification steps for bundle generation
- Implemented working directory specification for deployment

## Deployment Status
- Plugin-template deployment workflow is functional
- Last successful deployment: [Pending verification]
- Deployment URL: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev

## Important Decisions
1. Never modify plugin source code directly
2. Handle all adaptations in CI pipeline
3. Use submodules for plugin integration
4. Maintain separate deployment workflow for plugins
5. Use Deno's unstable-sloppy-imports as fallback

## Next Steps
1. Verify successful deployment of plugin-template
2. Add deployment status monitoring
3. Create documentation for plugin integration process
4. Implement cleanup of old deployments
5. Add automated testing for deployed plugins

## Lessons Learned
- Deno requires explicit file extensions in imports
- Git submodules require careful handling in CI
- Automated text processing can solve compatibility issues
- Separation of concerns is crucial for maintainability
- CI pipelines should adapt code, not developers
