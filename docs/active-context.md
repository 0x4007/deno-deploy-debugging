# Active Context: Deno Deploy CI Successfully Implemented

## Current Focus
- Successfully implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for Deno Deploy
- Both app and plugin deployments are working correctly
- All deployment issues have been resolved

## Recent Changes
- Created reusable GitHub Actions:
  - `.github/actions/app-deploy/action.yml` - For deploying Deno applications
  - `.github/actions/plugin-deploy/action.yml` - For deploying plugins with worker interface
  - `.github/actions/deno-deploy/action.yml` - Core deployment logic used by both
- Fixed deployment issues:
  - Resolved project creation permission errors by using organization ID
  - Fixed import path resolution in plugin deployments
  - Added conditional checkout to prevent file overwrites
  - Implemented proper environment variable filtering
- Created test workflows:
  - `.github/workflows/test-app-deploy.yml` - Tests app deployment
  - `.github/workflows/test-plugin-deploy.yml` - Tests plugin deployment

## Deployment URLs
- App: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev
- Plugin: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev (same project name for main branch)

## Key Implementation Details
- Project names are auto-generated based on repository name and branch
- Supports both personal and organization deployments
- Uses deployctl for actual deployment after project creation
- Environment variables are filtered and passed via .env file
- Production deployments are automatic for default branch

## Next Steps
1. Add deployment URL output to CI job summaries
2. Document the workflow usage in tech-context.md
3. Implement cleanup strategy for old Deno Deploy projects
4. Create environment-specific deployments (staging/production)

## Plugin Template Integration
- Added plugin-template as a git submodule in plugins/plugin-template
- Created adapter at plugins/plugin-template-adapter.ts to make template compatible
- Added test workflow at .github/workflows/test-plugin-template-deploy.yml

## Active Decisions
- Using reusable actions to maintain DRY principle
- Auto-generating project names to avoid conflicts
- Supporting both personal and organization deployments
- Using branch names in project names for multi-branch deployments
- Direct TypeScript deployment without compilation
