# Active Context: Plugin Template Deployment Debugging

## Current Focus
- Implementing bundling solution for Node.js plugins to run on Deno Deploy
- Developing transparent CI/CD pipeline that handles all transformations
- Maintaining plugin developer experience with standard Node.js tooling

## Recent Changes
- Added esbuild bundling step to plugin-deploy action
- Configured bundler to handle npm dependencies and create self-contained output
- Updated deployment to use bundled JavaScript file instead of source TypeScript
- Fixed import extension issues by using pre-bundled code
- Maintained compatibility with Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno Deploy

## Key Challenges Resolved
1. ~~Module resolution failures during deployment~~ ✓ Fixed with bundling
2. ~~Bare module imports not supported by Deno~~ ✓ Bundled into single file
3. ~~Import extension requirements in Deno~~ ✓ Bypassed with bundling
4. ~~npm dependencies not available in Deno~~ ✓ Included in bundle

## Solutions Implemented
- **Bundling Strategy**: Using esbuild to create self-contained JavaScript
- **Automatic Dependency Installation**: npm install runs in plugin directory
- **Platform-Neutral Output**: Bundle configured for ESM format, ES2022 target
- **Node.js Polyfills**: Added Buffer polyfill for compatibility
- **Environment Variables**: Defined NODE_ENV as "production" during bundling

## Deployment Architecture
```
Plugin Source (Node.js/TypeScript)
    ↓
CI: npm install
    ↓
CI: esbuild bundle
    ↓
Bundled JavaScript (self-contained)
    ↓
Deno Deploy
```

## Important Decisions
1. Use bundling to handle all module resolution transparently
2. Plugin developers write standard Node.js code
3. CI handles all Deno-specific transformations
4. Same plugin code works across all platforms
5. No manual import mapping or URL conversions needed

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment with bundled plugin
2. Optimize bundle size if needed
3. Add caching for npm dependencies
4. Document bundling configuration options
5. Consider adding source maps for debugging

## Lessons Learned
- Bundling is the most reliable way to handle cross-platform compatibility
- esbuild provides fast, reliable bundling for edge deployments
- Platform-specific transformations should be transparent to developers
- Self-contained bundles eliminate runtime dependency issues
- CI automation enables seamless multi-platform support
