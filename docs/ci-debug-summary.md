# CI Debugging Summary - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
The GitHub Actions CI workflow for deploying a Deno plugin was failing due to permission issues when creating projects on Deno Deploy.

## Debugging Steps
1. Used `gh` CLI to list recent workflow runs:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=hello-plugin-deploy.yml --limit 5
   ```

2. Examined failed run logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view 15756521971 --log-failed
   ```

3. Identified errors:
   ```
   APIError: The authorization token is not valid: You don't have permission to access the project
   ```

## Resolution Steps
1. **Fixed project creation permission issues**:
   - Modified workflow to support both organization and personal account deployments
   - Added fallback logic when organization doesn't exist

2. **Created reusable GitHub Actions**:
   - `app-deploy` - For deploying Deno applications
   - `plugin-deploy` - For deploying plugins with worker interface
   - `deno-deploy` - Core deployment logic used by both

3. **Fixed plugin deployment issues**:
   - Corrected import path resolution (./plugins → ../plugins)
   - Added conditional checkout to prevent file overwrites
   - Implemented proper environment variable filtering

## Final Solution
The workflow now:
1. Auto-generates project names based on repository and branch
2. Creates projects using deployctl with proper error handling
3. Deploys using deployctl with environment variables
4. Handles both app and plugin deployments
5. Supports production and preview deployments

## Current Status
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully
- ✅ Both app and plugin are deployed to Deno Deploy
- ✅ Latest successful runs:
  - App deployment: [15762540892](https://github.com/0x4007/deno-deploy-debugging/actions/runs/15762540892)
  - Plugin deployment: [15762570680](https://github.com/0x4007/deno-deploy-debugging/actions/runs/15762570680)

## Deployment URLs
- App: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev
- Plugin: https://deno-deploy-debugging-main.deno.dev

## Key Learnings
1. Deno Deploy requires careful handling of import paths in generated files
2. GitHub Actions nested actions need skip_checkout to preserve generated files
3. Environment variable filtering is important for security
4. Project name generation helps avoid conflicts in multi-branch setups
